              informal glimpse of your results within the next day or two but

              mark to be folded in to your assessment as a replacement for the
              mark you obtained in the first exam (including in the case where

              process. The old exam mark is discarded and the new one fully

              VCE中文大致可划分为三大板块：SACs、口试、笔试。且不说六次SAC考试中就有两个直接考你作文，在年底最关键的口试和笔试中，写作更是占据了至关重要的位置。口试本质上是什么？它本质上是写作与口语相结合的产物。口试要想考得好，一定要准备得够充分，有可能会被问到的问题，我们都要提前一一写好答案，以确保在实战时能做到临危不惧、对答如流。而且不但要写，还要写得好，写得精彩。写到最后，字数过万也是正常的。要是写作不过关，口试真的能考好吗？只能说很难。口试，不只看你说得好不好，还要看你说了些什么。你的内容要有深度，用词要精准，语言的表达也要清晰。口试中的种种要求都离不开写作，要想考得好，写作要好，口语也要好，缺一不可。
